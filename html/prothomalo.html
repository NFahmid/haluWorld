            Bangladesh Awami League is one of the oldest political parties in Bangladesh, going back to its ancestry in the post-partition Pakistan. In its treading a long path as an organisation, many people with illustrious backgrounds carried the responsibility as the general secretary of the party. Apparently the person who holds the post is the second-in-command of this large organisation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bongotaj Tajuddin Ahmad also carried out the responsibility as the general secretary of the Bangladesh Awami League and we all know his achievements. He led the nation in the months of bloodied liberation war when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remained behind the bars in Pakistan. And, then we have Mr. Obaidul Quader as the general secretary of the party now.
            <br>
            <br>
            A movement of students and job seekers has been going on since 1 July seeking reforms in the quota system in the government jobs. As the spokesperson of the governing party, Mr. Quader has been speaking to the media about his partyâ€™s reactions to the everyday developments in the agitation from the very beginning.
            <br>
            <br>
            During such a media briefing on 8 July, he provided a certain piece of information to the newspersons and asked them to check the veracity of that. He said that the top 31 leaders of the movement regarding quota in 2018 did not pass the civil service exams.
            <br>
            <br>
            What message did he want to convey through this?
            <br>
            <br>
            We like to believe there was no possibility of manipulating the exam results of top 31 leaders of the movement. But what point does he actually want to prove by dropping such information without giving any details like, how many of them took the test, how many of them crossed which part of the exams?
            <br>
            <br>
            Did he mean only those people who could pass the civil service exams have the right to say anything about it? Or, did he mean the people who would lead in some movement must be able to enjoy the material benefits of the system after successfully leading the agitation to its goal? Could we say this is a healthy thought process?
            <br>
            <br>
            If we go a bit far and ask, is this opinion regarding quota only or does this thought process cover many other policy-level decisions?
