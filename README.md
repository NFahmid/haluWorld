# 🗑️ Code Dumpster

Welcome to my personal **code playground** — a giant dumpster of everything I'm learning, building, or just experimenting with. No structure, no pressure. Just code.

This repo contains **practice code, tutorials, exercises, failed experiments, half-baked ideas**, and more — across multiple programming languages and frameworks.

## 📁 What's Inside

A (somewhat organized) mess of folders:

### 💻 Programming Languages
- `c/` — Classic C programs and logic building
- `c++/` — STL, OOP, and competitive programming prep
- `Go/` — Go basics and CLI tools
- `java/` — Core Java and some OOP exercises
- `Python/` — Scripts, challenges, and fun with libraries

### 🌐 Web Development
- `html/` — HTML experiments and templates
- `css/` — (likely inside `html` or `tailwind`)
- `javascript/` — Small scripts and DOM practice
- `React/` — Components, hooks, and project trials
- `Next/` — Experiments with Next.js framework
- `NodeJS/` — APIs, backends, and server-side stuff
- `tailwind/` — Tailwind CSS trials
- `django/` — Python + Django full stack practice
- `Spring Boot/` — Java-based backend projects
- `WebPage Development/` — Possibly full mock sites or UI builds

### 🧠 Problem Solving & Misc
- `Codeforces/` — Competitive programming problems
- `To-Do-List/` — Task/project-based mini apps
- `rough/` — Random tests, failed attempts, quick tries
